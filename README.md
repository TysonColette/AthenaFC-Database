## Data Model Construction
In collaboration with the chosen client scenario via ChatGPT:

1. Identify crucial entities, attributes, and relationships specific to the client's business.
2. Document the data model using an Entity Relationship Diagram.
3. Create the database in MySQL and populate it with artifical data.
4. Craft SQL queries that give managerial insight into the clients business.
